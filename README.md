## Requirements

- [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/) app from Steam store. Steam must be running in the background for the example to function properly because it uses [SteamVR v2.6.1 (sdk 1.13.10)](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.6.1) for hand interactions and animations.
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

After installing Git LFS, clone the repository in a directory of your choice:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mahilab/SyntactsVR
```

To open the project, open `assets/SyntactsVR.unity`.
